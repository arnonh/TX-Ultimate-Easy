## Integration with Home Assistant

TX Ultimate Easy exposes your device's components (sensors, touch panel, relays, etc.) to Home Assistant,
allowing you to:

- Monitor sensor states and values
- Control device components through the Home Assistant UI
- Use device triggers and states in your Home Assistant automations and scripts
- Configure device behavior through Home Assistant's service calls

All automation capabilities are handled through Home Assistant's
native automation system - this project focuses on providing reliable
device integration rather than implementing its own automation tools.

### Event-Based Automation

TX Ultimate Easy uses Home Assistant's native Events system for reliable automation triggers.
While sensors show the current state (e.g., button pressed/not pressed),
events capture-specific actions like clicks, swipes, and long presses.

For more details, please refer to our **[Events docs](docs/events.md)**.

### Device Configuration
#### Relay Modes
- **Light Mode**: Exposes the relay as a light entity with brightness controls (if supported)
- **Switch Mode**: Exposes the relay as a simple on/off switch entity

#### Button Actions
- **None**: Allows using button events for custom automations
  Example: Trigger scenes or complex automations through Home Assistant
- **Relay Toggle**: Direct control of the associated relay
  Example: Toggle relay state with each press, independent of Home Assistant

#### Automation
All device behaviors can be customized through Home Assistant automations without relying on local device triggers.

## Key Features

- **Home Assistant UI Configuration**: Manage all device settings directly through the Home Assistant interface
- **Zero YAML Knowledge Required**: After initial setup, no manual YAML editing needed
- **Flexible Light Control**: Customize LED behavior and effects
- **Touch Panel Support**: Full support for touch gestures and multi-touch capabilities
- **Advanced Automations**: Create complex automations using Home Assistant's powerful automation engine
- **BLE Proxy Support**: Optional Bluetooth Low Energy proxy functionality
- **Audio Feedback**: Built-in speaker support for audible feedback
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration motor support for tactile feedback

## Hardware Support

- Compatible with all Sonoff TX Ultimate variants:
  - EU format (Square, T5-xC-86)
  - US format (Rectangle, T5-xC-120)
  - 1/2/3/4 gang versions

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

1. A Sonoff TX Ultimate device
2. Home Assistant installation
3. ESPHome add-on installed in Home Assistant
4. Basic knowledge of Home Assistant

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your TX Ultimate device up and running with ESPHome.

### ESPHome Integration Setup

1. Install the ESPHome add-on in Home Assistant if not already installed:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Add-on Store
   - Search for "ESPHome" 
   - Click Install
2. Start the ESPHome add-on and verify it's running
3. Access ESPHome dashboard through Home Assistant

### Setup Device

1. In the ESPHome dashboard, click "+ New Device"
2. Name your device (e.g., "tx-ultimate-living-room")
3. Select ESP32 as your device type
4. Copy this basic configuration to your new device:
   ```yaml
   substitutions:
     name: tx-ultimate-easy  # Change this to your device name
     friendly_name: TX Ultimate Easy
   
   packages:
     remote_package:
       url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/TX-Ultimate-Easy
       ref: main  # For latest stable release
       files:
         - TX-Ultimate-Easy-ESPHome.yaml
   
   wifi:
     ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
     password: !secret wifi_password
   ```

   You can also use a specific version tag for better control over updates:
   ```yaml
   ref: v2024.12.2  # Using specific version for controlled updates
   ```
    **Note:** [Click here](https://github.com/edwardtfn/TX-Ultimate-Easy/tags) for a full list of versions available.
5. Click "Save" and then "Install"

### Device Flashing

Initial flashing must be done via serial connection.
We recommend using [ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io) for the simplest experience.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **SAFETY WARNINGS**
> - ALWAYS disconnect the device from mains power before opening
> - NEVER work on the device while connected to mains power
> - Ensure the device is completely powered off before making any connections
> - Keep your workspace clean, dry, and static-free
> - Use proper insulated tools when working with electronics
> - If unsure about any step, seek help from an experienced person

> [!CAUTION]
>‚ö° **CRITICAL: VOLTAGE WARNING**
> Using a UART adapter with voltage higher than 3.3V WILL DAMAGE YOUR DEVICE.
> Double-check your adapter's voltage before connecting - many common FTDI adapters
> default to 5V which will permanently damage the ESP32 chip.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

#### Required Hardware
- USB-to-UART adapter:
  - 3.3V logic level ONLY (DO NOT use 5V adapters)
  - Must be capable of supplying at least 500mA
  - Common adapters: CP2102, CH340, FTDI (ensure 3.3V setting)
- Small Phillips screwdriver
- 5 wires for connections (including one for BOOT to GND)

#### Flashing Process
1. Open your TX Ultimate device carefully
2. Locate the programming header pins
3. Connect your USB-to-UART adapter:

   | Adapter | Device |
   |---------|--------|
   | GND     | GND    |
   | 3.3V    | 3.3V   |
   | TX      | RX     |
   | RX      | TX     |

4. Put device in flash mode:
   - Temporarily connect the BOOT pin to GND using a jumper wire
   - While holding BOOT to GND, power up the device
   - After device powers up (wait a couple of seconds), remove the BOOT to GND connection
5. Visit [ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io)
6. Connect to your device and flash the firmware
7. After successful flash, device will restart and be ready for OTA updates

#### Detailed Visual Guides
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
For step-by-step visual instructions, you can reference these existing guides:
- üá¨üáß [WirelessThings Guide](https://wirelessthings.io/index.php/2023/12/19/how-to-flash-sonoff-tx-ultimate-with-esphome/) - English guide with detailed photos
- üá™üá∏ [Un loco y su tecnolog√≠a](https://youtu.be/58v8oqSQgXQ?t=143) - Spanish video tutorial
- üá©üá™ [SmartHome yourself](https://youtu.be/naDLhX89enQ?t=465) - German video tutorial
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Note: While these guides may use different firmware, the physical flashing process remains the same.

#### Subsequent Updates
After initial flashing, all future updates can be done wirelessly (OTA)
through the ESPHome dashboard in your ESPHome add-on.

### Home Assistant Integration

After successful flashing:
1. Ensure your device and Home Assistant are on the same network
2. Device should be automatically discovered within 1‚Äì2 minutes
3. Accept the discovery notification in Home Assistant to add device
   Note: If discovery takes longer than 5 minutes, proceed to troubleshooting steps
4. Device will appear in your Home Assistant Devices dashboard

#### Troubleshooting Integration
If the device isn't discovered automatically:
1. Verify your device is powered and connected to your network:
   - Look for the device in your router's client list
   - Consider using [manual IP](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html#manual-ips) in your device
2. If you missed the discovery notification:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
   - Click "Add Integration"
   - Search for "ESPHome" and enter your device's IP address
3. Still having issues?
   - Check your network allows mDNS/discovery traffic
   - Verify there are no VLANs or network isolation preventing communication
   - Try rebooting both the device and Home Assistant

### Initial Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to:
   - Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí ESPHome
   - Click on your device to access its configuration page
2. Set basic device parameters:
   - Model format (EU/US)
